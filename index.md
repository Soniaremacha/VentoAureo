# Raiden, by Vento Áureo

## Hello and welcome to Vento áureo , a team that will replicate Raiden to the fullest!

Raiden is a scrolling shoot’em up arcade game developed by Seibu Kaihatsu in 1990, being the first game in the Raiden Series and released for Arcade, Atari, PC, PlayStation and even mobile phone.

Raiden has eight stages where you take control of the Raiden Supersonic Attack Fighter, a new cutting-edge weapon created by the World Alliance Military to stop the alien invasion.

Through bombs and missile powerups, the player must destroy enemy crafts and dodge their bullets to add points to their score.

After defeating the Stage 8 boss, you return to Stage 1 with a harder version of the game where enemies attack faster.
