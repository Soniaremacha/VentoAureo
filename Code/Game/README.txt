** RAIDEN DESCRIPTION ***************************************************

Raiden is a scrolling shoot’em up arcade game developed by Seibu Kaihatsu
in 1990, being the first game in the Raiden Series and released for 
Arcade, Atari, PC, PlayStation and even mobile phone.

Raiden has eight stages where you take control of the Raiden Supersonic 
Attack Fighter, a new cutting-edge weapon created by the World Alliance 
Military to stop the alien invasion.

Through bombs and missile powerups, the player must destroy enemy crafts 
and dodge their bullets to add points to their score.

After defeating the Stage 8 boss, you return to Stage 1 with a harder 
version of the game where enemies attack faster.
